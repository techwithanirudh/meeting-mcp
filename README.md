# Meeting BaaS MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for managing meeting data, including transcripts, recordings, calendar events, and search functionality.

## Overview

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows AI assistants like Claude and Cursor to access and manipulate meeting data. It exposes a set of tools and resources that can be used to:

- **Invite Meeting Bots**: Create and invite bots to your video conferences that automatically record and transcribe meetings

  ```
  "Create a new meeting bot for my Zoom call tomorrow"
  ```

- **Query Meeting Data**: Search through meeting transcripts and find specific information without watching entire recordings

  ```
  "Search my recent meetings for discussions about the quarterly budget"
  "Find all mentions of Project Apollo in yesterday's team meeting"
  "Show me parts of the meeting where Jane was speaking"
  ```

- **Manage Calendar Events**: View and organize calendar entries and upcoming meetings

- **Access Recording Information**: Get metadata about meeting recordings and their status

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm
- **MeetingBaaS Account**: You need access to a MeetingBaaS account using your corporate email address
  - All logs, bots, and shared links are available to colleagues with the same corporate domain (not personal emails like gmail.com)
  - This enables seamless collaboration where all team members can access meeting recordings and transcripts created by anyone in your organization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mcp-baas
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

Start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

By default, the server runs on port 7017 and exposes the MCP endpoint at `http://localhost:7017/mcp`.

## Example Workflows

### Recording a Meeting

1. Create a bot for your upcoming meeting:

   ```
   "Create a bot for my Zoom meeting at https://zoom.us/j/123456789"
   ```

2. The bot joins the meeting automatically and begins recording.

3. Check recording status:
   ```
   "What's the status of my meeting recording for the Zoom call I started earlier?"
   ```

### Calendar Integration and Automatic Recording

1. Get guidance on obtaining OAuth credentials:

   ```
   "I want to integrate my Google Calendar. How do I get OAuth credentials?"
   ```

2. List your available calendars before integration:

   ```
   "List my available Google calendars. Here are my OAuth credentials:
   - Client ID: my-client-id-123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com
   - Client Secret: my-client-secret-ABCDEF123456
   - Refresh Token: my-refresh-token-ABCDEF123456789"
   ```

3. Set up calendar integration with a specific calendar:

   ```
   "Integrate my Google Calendar using these credentials:
   - Platform: Google
   - Client ID: my-client-id-123456789.apps.googleusercontent.com
   - Client Secret: my-client-secret-ABCDEF123456
   - Refresh Token: my-refresh-token-ABCDEF123456789
   - Raw Calendar ID: primary@gmail.com"
   ```

4. View your upcoming meetings:

   ```
   "Show me my upcoming meetings from calendar 1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d"
   ```

5. Schedule recording for an upcoming meeting:

   ```
   "Schedule a recording for my team meeting with event ID 7a8b9c0d-1e2f-3a4b-5c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d.
   Configure the bot with:
   - Name: Team Meeting Bot
   - Recording Mode: gallery_view
   - Entry Message: Hello everyone, I'm here to record the meeting"
   ```

6. Check all recordings scheduled in your calendar:

   ```
   "Show me all meetings in my calendar that have recordings scheduled"
   ```

7. Cancel a previously scheduled recording:

   ```
   "Cancel the recording for event 7a8b9c0d-1e2f-3a4b-5c6d-7e8f9a0b1c2d"
   ```

8. Refresh calendar data if meetings are missing:

   ```
   "Force a resync of all my connected calendars"
   ```

### Simplified Calendar Integration

For a simpler approach to calendar integration, you can directly configure your calendar OAuth credentials in the Claude Desktop configuration file:

1. Edit the configuration file:
   ```bash
   vim ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. Add the `calendarOAuth` section to your botConfig:
   ```json
   "botConfig": {
     // other bot configuration...
     
     "calendarOAuth": {
       "platform": "Google",  // or "Microsoft"
       "clientId": "YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID",
       "clientSecret": "YOUR_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET", 
       "refreshToken": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN",
       "rawCalendarId": "primary@gmail.com"  // Optional
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop - your calendar will be automatically integrated.

This approach eliminates the need to manually call the OAuth setup tools, making calendar integration a one-time configuration task.

> **Note:** Calendar integration is completely optional. You can use Meeting BaaS without connecting a calendar by simply omitting the `calendarOAuth` section from your configuration. Calendar integration enhances the experience by providing access to your upcoming meetings and enabling automatic recording of calendar events.

### Analyzing Meeting Content

1. Search for specific topics:

   ```
   "Find all mentions of the marketing budget in yesterday's team meeting"
   ```

2. Get insights from specific speakers:

   ```
   "What did Sarah say about the new product launch in our meeting last Tuesday?"
   ```

3. Get meeting summaries:
   ```
   "Summarize the key points from this morning's standup meeting"
   ```

4. Search across meeting types:
   ```
   "Search for discussions about patient symptoms across all psychiatric meetings"
   ```

5. Find topics with context:
   ```
   "Find discussions about quarterly targets in meeting abc-123 and show me the surrounding conversation"
   ```

6. Find specific video segments:
   ```
   "Show me the video segments where John was speaking between 15 and 20 minutes into meeting xyz-456"
   ```

7. Search using meeting metadata:
   ```
   "Search my sales meetings for mentions of the new pricing strategy"
   ```

8. Use natural language search across all meetings:
   ```
   "Find any discussions about budget concerns in meetings from last week"
   "Show me what Sarah said about the product roadmap in recent meetings"
   "Search for conversations about customer feedback in yesterday's standup"
   "Find meeting segments where the team discussed implementation timeframes"
   ```

9. Use the different intelligent search approaches:
   ```
   // Bot ID-based search
   "Search in meeting abc-123 for mentions of the new product launch"
   
   // Calendar-based search
   "Find discussions about deadlines in my marketing team calendar"
   "Search through my work calendar for meetings where we discussed the budget"
   
   // Recent meetings search (no explicit bot ID needed)
   "What did Alex say about the database migration?"
   "Show me the parts where we talked about customer requirements"
   ```

10. Share direct links to specific moments in meetings:
   ```
   "Find when we discussed the marketing budget and give me a shareable link to that moment"
   "Create a link to the part of yesterday's meeting where Sarah presented the Q4 roadmap"
   "Share the segment of the design review where we debated the user interface changes"
   ```

11. Use AI to find and share key moments from a meeting:
   ```
   "Find key moments in our last product planning meeting and share links to them"
   "Create a table of contents with links for the quarterly review meeting"
   "Share the parts of the interview where the candidate discussed their experience with React"
   "Automatically find and share important moments from meeting abc-123"
   ```

### Using Direct Credential Tools

You can provide API credentials directly in your queries:

1. List events with direct credentials:

   ```
   "List events from calendar 5c99f8a4-f498-40d0-88f0-29f698c53c51 using API key tesban where attendee is philipe@spoke.app"
   ```

2. Schedule a recording with direct credentials:

   ```
   "Schedule a recording for event 78d06b42-794f-4efe-8195-62db1f0052d5 using API key tesban with bot name 'Weekly Meeting Bot'"
   ```

3. Cancel a recording with direct credentials:

   ```
   "Cancel the recording for event 97cd62f0-ea9b-42b3-add5-7a607ce6d80f using API key tesban"
   ```

4. Get meeting data with direct credentials:

   ```
   "Get meeting data for meeting 47de9462-bea7-406c-b79a-fd6b82c3de76 using API key tesban"
   ```

### Accessing Meeting Recordings

Meeting recordings can be accessed directly through the Meeting BaaS viewer using the bot ID:

```
https://meetingbaas.com/viewer/{BOT_ID}
```

For example:
```
https://meetingbaas.com/viewer/67738f48-2360-4f9e-a999-275a74208ff5
```

This viewer provides:
- The meeting video recording
- Synchronized transcript with speaker identification
- Navigation by speaker or topic
- Direct link sharing with teammates

When using the `createBot`, `getBots`, or search tools, you'll receive bot IDs that can be used to construct these viewer URLs for easy access to recordings.

> **Important**: All meeting recordings and links are automatically shared with colleagues who have the same corporate email domain (e.g., @yourcompany.com). This allows your entire team to access recordings without requiring individual permissions, creating a collaborative environment where meeting knowledge is accessible to everyone in your organization.

## Configuration

The server can be configured through environment variables or by editing the `src/config.ts` file.

Key configuration options:

- `PORT`: The port the server listens on (default: 7017)
- `API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the Meeting BaaS API

      "tags": ["technical", "planning", "retrospective"]      // Flexible tagging system
    }
    ```

The `extra` field is extremely flexible - you can add any structured metadata that makes sense for your organization and use cases. All of this metadata is fully searchable by the `intelligentSearch` tool, which can extract meaning from natural language queries.

## Integration with Cursor

To integrate with Cursor:

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to Settings
3. Navigate to "Model Context Protocol"
4. Add a new server with:
   - Name: "Meeting BaaS MCP"
   - Type: "sse"
   - Server URL: "http://localhost:7017/mcp"
   - Optionally add headers if authentication is required

## Development

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Test with MCP Inspector

```bash
npm run inspect
```

### Development mode (with auto-reload)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Log Management

The server includes optimized logging with:

```bash
npm run cleanup
```

This command:
- Cleans up unnecessary log files and cached data
- Filters out repetitive ping messages from logs
- Reduces disk usage while preserving important log information
- Maintains a smaller log footprint for long-running servers

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts`: Main entry point
- `src/tools/`: Tool implementations
- `src/resources/`: Resource definitions
- `src/api/`: API client for the Meeting BaaS backend
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions
- `src/config.ts`: Server configuration
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions
  - `logging.ts`: Log filtering and management
  - `tinyDb.ts`: Persistent bot tracking database

## Authentication

The server expects an API key in the `x-api-key` header for authentication. You can configure the default API key in the configuration.

Direct authentication is also supported in many tools (named with "WithCredentials") where you can provide the API key directly as a parameter rather than in headers.

## Advanced Features

### Persistent Bot Tracking

The server maintains a persistent database of recently used bots, which enables:

- Contextual follow-up queries about meetings without needing to specify the bot ID
- Improved topic matching across multiple meetings
- Automatic knowledge of meeting participants, topics, and context
- Enhanced intelligent search capabilities

This tracking is completely transparent to users and dramatically improves the experience when having conversations about meetings over time.

### Intelligent Adaptive Search

- Searches by meeting type, participants, or keywords when exact bot ID isn't known
- Automatically uses calendar data when available
- Remembers previous meeting context for follow-up questions
